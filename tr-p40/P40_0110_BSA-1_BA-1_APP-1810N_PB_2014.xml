This cost code procures the LM2500 single shank gas turbine generators for the DDG-51 &amp; LCS-2 class ships and the LM2500+ single shank gas turbine generators for the LHD8/LHA6 class ships. The programs projected FY-13 in-service population of single shank gas turbine engines is 332, increasing to 382 in FY-18 due to new construction.  Breakdown of ship class spare procurement is listed below.  The procurement of these engines includes all required shipping/storage containers.

DDG LM2500 Single Shank Spare turbines
Based on experience with 35 years of usage demand data on the LM2500 Engine and IAW 10 USC Sec. 2308, DFAR subpart 207.70 and DoDI 3110.06, a total of 36 spares are required to support the fleet requirements. Current on-hand is 27 with one (1) procured in FY-11 leaving a requirement for eight (8) additional gas generator units to be procured IAW projected class population in FY18.


LCS 2 LM2500 Single Shank Spare turbines 
Based on experience with 35 years of usage demand data on the LM2500 Engine and IAW 10 USC Sec. 2308, DFAR subpart 207.70 and DoDI 3110.06, a total of 3 spares are required to support the fleet requirements. Current on-hand is 1 with one (1) procured in May FY12 which leaves the requirement for one (1) additional gas generator unit to be procured IAW projected class population in FY18.

LHD8/LHA6 LM2500+ Single Shank Spare turbines 
Based on experience with 35 years of usage demand data on the LM2500 Engine and IAW 10 USC Sec. 2308, DFAR subpart 207.70 and DoDI 3110.06, a total of 2 spares are required to support the fleet requirements. Current on-hand is 1, which leaves the requirement for one (1) additional gas generator to be procured IAW projected class population as of FY18. The program has budgeted to procure one (1) LM2500+ Engine and one (1) Power Turbine Assembly in FY18 to meet the baseline requirement. This engine represents a significantly different configuration than the standard LM2500 Single Shank Engine procured in previous fiscal years.

													
LM2500 Hot Section Kits										
Are procured on an as required basis from the below list per quarterly failure analysis and maintained to replace High Pressure Turbine (HPT) components beyond economical repair (BER). 					
Shortages of replacement blades increase engine repair turn-around during engine refurbishment/repair as a result of material shortages. 										
Procurement quantities are a result of procuring various kits of various costs. The kits included in the cost code are as follows:														
--HPT Shrouds											
--HPT Seal Assembly											
--HPT Blades 											
--HPT Nozzles 												
--Compressor Blades

[P40A / GA012 CONTROL SYSTEMS MODIFICATIONS]: GA012 - CONTROL SYSTEM MODIFICATIONS														
This cost code funds the procurement and installation of the Aft Steering Local Control Unit and Damage Control Hard Drives following control system modifications:							
Aft steering local control unit single board computers are currently obsolete and require replacement.  
Installation is required to be completed on 24 ships. Installations do not require CNO availabilities.  Installations will be accomplished during pier side availability by NSWCCD-SSES.					
There are 4 kits required per ship. The kits include the following hardware:  single board computer, daughter board, transceiver, power cables, and associated software packages.  						
Current Damage Control Workstation hard drives are currently obsolete and require replacement. In order to maintain commonality in configuration a one-time bulk buy in FY12 is required as vendor is phasing-out the production of this unit.						
Installation is required to be completed on 24 ships. There are seven (7) hard drives required per ship. Installations do not require CNO availabilities.  Installations will be accomplished during pier side availability by NSWCCD-SSES.

[P40A / GA014 SPECIAL SUPPORT EQUIPMENT (SSE)]: GA014 - SPECIAL SUPPORT EQUIPMENT (SSE) Procurement of Special Support Equipment allows for increased depot repair capability, thereby stabilizing or reducing the cost to overhaul engines at the depot.  This tooling is generally associated with depot modifications being made to the engine to increase engine reliability.  This increased capability reduces engine overhaul costs.

[P40A / GA015 LM2500 DIGITAL FUEL CONTROL]: GA015 - DIGITAL FUEL CONTROL (DFC)														
This cost code procures the Digital Fuel Control (DFC) shipsets, ancillary equipment and install material to support the CG/DDG modernization schedules. Procurement and installations are budgeted to correspond with CNO ship availabilities. One DFC Kit is required to upgrade each of the four LM2500 engines, which makes one DFC shipset.  Each shipset requires up to a 12 month lead time due to contracting process, production, assembly and shipping. 		
			
The DFC is the most significant change to the LM2500 engine since its inception into the USN that addresses obsolescence components which accounted for approximately 40% of all engine failures. This modification is estimated to be 75% more reliable than the old system. 								
This upgrade replaces the existing Hydro-mechanical main fuel control (MFC) system which was designed for aircraft; with a Digital Fuel Control (DFC) system designed for military marine environment. This modification increases engine reliability, decreases PMS, enhances operational functions, and provides an automatic stall detection and shutdown capability.

[P40A / GA016 MANAGEMENT ENERGY INITIATIVES]: GA016 - MANAGEMENT ENERGY INITIATIVES																	
This cost code procures the materials and funds installation of the LM2500 energy initiatives, which include online waterwash and LM-2500 fuel efficiency improvements:																	
Online Waterwash											
The online waterwash systems yield fuel savings by reducing engine compressor fouling.  This also reduces the number of offline washes performed, which translates into a reduction in hazardous waste, engine downtime, man-power, and starter wear, leading to an overall maintenance savings.							
Online waterwash will be installed on a total of 62 ships (DDG-51 Class ships) or 248 LM2500 Engines. A shipset comprises four (4) online waterwash kits.								
Online waterwash installation consists of adding a 3-way solenoid valve, online waterwash nozzles, and associated hardware to the existing crank wash piping. The system will be aligned similarly to the crank waterwash system, but will allow online washes to be performed during the gas turbine operation.																	
LM-2500 Fuel Efficiency Improvements									
LM-2500 Fuel Efficiency Improvement is being developed under the Electric Ship Office (ESO), PE 0603573N / Project 2471 in FY's 12-14.  LM-2500 Fuel Efficiency kits consist of materials and components which will cool compressor and turbine components; software to improve fuel scheduling; and internal and external flow optimization hardware.	
"LM2500 Fuel Efficiency upgrade kits will be installed during overhaul at Fleet Readiness Center, San Diego."

[P3A / GA015 DIGITAL FUEL CONTROL SHIPSET]: GA015 - DIGITAL FUEL CONTROL (DFC)									
This cost code procures the Digital Fuel Control (DFC) shipsets, ancillary equipment and install material to support the CG/DDG modernization schedules. 								
One DFC Kit is required to upgrade each of the four LM2500 engines, which makes one DFC shipset.  Each shipset requires up to a 12 month lead time due to contracting process, production, assembly and shipping. 		
One additional Digital Fuel Control (DFC) kit will be procured for the one LM2500 Engine Trainer at the Naval Training Center, Great Lakes to maintain a common configuration with the fleet.					
The DFC is the most significant change to the LM2500 engine since its inception into the USN that addresses obsolescence components which accounted for approximately 40% of all engine failures. In summary this modification is estimated to be 75% more reliable than the old system. 		
This upgrade replaces the existing Hydro-mechanical main fuel control (MFC) system which was designed for aircraft; with a Digital Fuel Control (DFC) system designed for military marine environment. This modification increases engine reliability, decreases PMS, enhances operational functions, and provides an automatic stall detection and shutdown capability.

        	[GA015 DIGITAL FUEL CONTROL SHIPSET] This cost code procures the Digital Fuel Control (DFC) shipsets, ancillary equipment and install material to support the CG/DDG modernization schedules. 									
One DFC Kit is required to upgrade each of the four LM2500 engines, which makes one DFC shipset.  Each shipset requires up to a 12 month lead time due to contracting process, production, assembly and shipping. 			

One additional Digital Fuel Control (DFC) kit was procured for the one LM2500 Engine Trainer at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center to maintain a common configuration with the fleet in FY12. Total kits procured in FY12 is 9 kits or 2.25 shipsets, which yields a unit cost of $1,558,973 as opposed the $1,614,000 detailed in the P3A.
				
The DFC is the most significant change to the LM2500 engine since its inception into the USN that addresses obsolescence components which accounted for approximately 40% of all engine failures. In summary this modification is estimated to be 75% more reliable than old system. 							

This upgrade replaces the existing Hydro-mechanical main fuel control (MFC) system which was designed for aircraft; 
with a Digital Fuel Control (DFC) system designed for military marine environment. This modification increases engine reliability, decreases PMS, enhances operational functions, and provides an automatic stall detection and shutdown capability.
